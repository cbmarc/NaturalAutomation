# SeleniumJBehavePoC #

## Description ##
For now this is a prove of concept of Jbehave and Selenium using spring-boot.

This is a WorkInProgress project. I do it in my free time and there is no finish date defined.

## Goal ##

The goal is to have a skeleton framework to use wherever needed, easily extendable and well documented. Oviously that goal is still a tad to far :)

# SeleniumJBehavePoC

Prove of Concept of Jbehave and Selenium using spring-boot.

This is a WorkInProgress project. I do it in my free time. 

##Â Goal

The goal is to have a skeleton framework to use wherever needed, easily extendable and well documented. Oviously that goal is still a tad to far :)
